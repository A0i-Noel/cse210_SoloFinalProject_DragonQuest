Hero, defeat the dragon hidden in the hinterland.
However, the dragon is so strong that it gains experience by rejecting monsters along the way.
Monsters will fight back if you attack or get too close, so be careful of your physical strength and fight, and you can recover by picking up the herbs that have fallen occasionally.
